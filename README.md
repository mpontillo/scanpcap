[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/mpontillo/scanpcap.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/mpontillo/scanpcap)

`scanpcap` is a tool that scans through a packet capture file and prints
statistics about it.

It takes as an argument the name of a file (in pcapng format), and outputs
some basic statistics about them, such as:

 - Number of packets
 - Number of Ethernet packets
 - Number of ARP packets
 - Maximum packet size
 - Minimum packet size
 - Start, end, and elapsed time of the capture
 - Bytes captured (includingn truncated bytes)
 - Overall capture speed (bits captured divided by capture interval in seconds)

For Ethernet links, also reports on:
 - Count of packets per Ethernet source address
 - Count of packets per Ethernet destination address
 - Any ARP mappings observed

See Also
========

Please note that `scanpcap` was written as a learning tool. Since it seemed
useful, I decided to release it.

However, if you are trying to do serious work with packet capturing, it
might be better to look at a more advanced tool, such as:

 - [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/)
 - [Bro Network Security Monitor](http://www.bro.org/)

Building
========

`scanpcap` includes a CMake build file. To build, ensure `cmake` is installed.
Then do something like this:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
